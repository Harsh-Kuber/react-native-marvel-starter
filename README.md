# Marvel Starter - React Native
This starter provides a service to talk to the Marvel api. It already displays the results from the api call on the main component.

* Display the thumbnail and name of the character
* Make the list of characters scrollable

## Harder
* Convert the main screen to a the search results screen
* Add a screen before this that lets you search characters by name
  * The dispatchable action already supports this as a parameter
* User should be able to enter a character name and click a search button
  * If no search term provided it should return the default results
* The user should be sent to the search results screen and be able to scroll through the results.
* Create a "back to search" button that returns to the previous screen
